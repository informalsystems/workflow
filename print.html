<p>This guide introduced Workflow, a language for describing, diagnosing, and constructing organizations.
It contains guidelines for using Workflow in your own organization.

<h2 id="what-is-workflow"><a class="header" href="#what-is-workflow">What is Workflow?</a></h2>
<p>Workflow is a language for describing, diagnosing, and constructing
accountability relationships within an organization. It is effectively a model
for making and managing promises. It was taught to Informal by Melissa Angeli and Laura McKinney of Jaquarden Consulting, with
powerful results.  Laura and Melissa were previously the CEO and Head of HR, respectively, for
Galois, a successful R&amp;D company in the US with an acclaimed organizational
design, known as the <a href="https://galois.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CW-picmet-proceedings.pdf">collaborative web</a>. Their paper on the subject describes
common dysfunctions in management and leadership and how the collaborative web
structure resolves them. It is well worth reading.</p>
<p>At Informal we feel that workflow is a model for how to organize and scale
organizations and we believe it can provide tremendous value to companies
looking to scale in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>We can describe Workflow as a model for how we navigate promises. The model can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diagnose issues interfering with our work together</li>
<li>Provide structure for new work</li>
<li>Build empathy and relationship by seeing promise making and keeping as a skill to be developed</li>
<li>Enhance communication by tools that allow people to focus on the barriers and issues directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The model is useful for small tasks through complex partnerships. In the end, it
facilitates trust. The model is straightforward to learn and can be put into
practice immediately. The value of the model is only experienced over time, as
it is used consistently and becomes interwoven with the organization's culture.</p>
<p>By providing a language for talking about promises - about the stages of promisemaking and redemption -
Workflow helps eliminate a lot of the ambiguity and
awkwardness that can come from dealing with accountability. In doing so, it
illuminates opportunities for improved organizational practices and designs.</p>
<p>In the rest of this guide, we describe the model and some of the many aspects of an organization it
sheds light on: planning and OKRs, project roles, effective meetings, functional
teams, decision authorities, employee stewardship, KPIs, etc.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-workflow-works"><a class="header" href="#how-workflow-works">How Workflow Works</a></h1>
<p>A Workflow is a relationship between two agents, usually two individuals within
an organization, which we call the “Customer” and the “Performer”. The Customer
holds some concern, an objective, for which it seeks satisfaction in some
time-frame. The Performer promises to satisfy by delivering some negotiated
results. In some sense, Workflow can be considered a more general model for
understanding and successfully utilizing OKRs.</p>
<p>A Workflow is a cycle, made up of four quadrants: Listen, Negotiate,
Execute, Assess. The following diagram sumarizes the key aspects of each
quadrant.</p>
<p><img src="./images/workflow.png" alt="Workflow Image" /></p>
<h2 id="the-four-phases-of-workflow"><a class="header" href="#the-four-phases-of-workflow">The Four Phases of Workflow</a></h2>
<p>In Q1 (Listen), the Customer seeks out a Performer to help satisfy their objective. They
listen to each other to develop a shared understanding of the concern and if
they would be a good fit to work together.</p>
<p>In Q2 (Negotiate), the Customer and Performer
negotiate on some results (the “conditions of satisfaction”, or CoS), yielding a
promise. This is a commitment by the Performer on how they intend to satisfy
the Customer’s concern.</p>
<p>In Q3 (Execute), the Performer executes on the promise.</p>
<p>In Q4 (Assess), the promise is redeemed, the work is reviewed, satisfaction is determined, and
the cycle repeats. Sometimes, during Q3 (Execution), you discover new
information or something happens that requires a renegotiation, so you go back
to Q2 (Negotiate).</p>
<h2 id="how-workflow-is-used"><a class="header" href="#how-workflow-is-used">How Workflow is Used</a></h2>
<p>We use this language directly in our conversations with each other to determine
where we are in an accountability cycle. We say things like, “who is the
Customer for this concern, and who is Performing for them?”, “can we do a Q2 to
negotiate some results for that concern”, “Is that a Q2 promise?”, “can we go
back to Q2 on this”, “let’s do a Q4”, and so on.</p>
<p>While it seems obvious and trivial, it can be used on virtually any scale in an
organization to improve expectations, accountability, empathy, and overall
working relationships. Workflow could be used on the scale of the CEO making
long term promises to the Board of Directors to align the company's strategy,
down to using it on daily Zoom meetings to ensure we’re not wasting our time
and our meetings produce value, and everything in between.</p>
<p>In principle, everything anyone is doing at any time is part of some Workflow.
Each person is likely to be on multiple Workflows at a time, as a customer for
some and a performer for others. Importantly, every workflow has a “dual”
Workflow, in the sense that the Customer is responsible for the Performer’s
success (ie. you could say that the Customer is performing for the Performer,
making a promise to help them be successful). Customership is an active job. It
involves clearly articulating a concern, helpfully negotiating on results,
checking in regularly, and providing helpful feedback. To say it again, the
Customer is responsible for the Performer’s success. Being a good Customer
(ie. taking responsibility for the performer's success) is
one of the hardest and most important components of the Workflow model.</p>
<p>Many Workflows will often remain implicit, and repeated patterns of Workflows
tend to become abstracted into “roles”. The activity of an organization is
essentially its collection of Workflows. We can use the Workflow language to
diagnose and improve communication as necessary, and to organize our overall
planning.</p>
<p>Workflow can be used to describe any organizational structure, even if it’s not
explicitly using the Workflow terminology. Typical management relationships and
reporting lines and so on involve many implicit Workflows and promises. By
surfacing those Workflows and promises explicitly, we can significantly improve
the overall management structure.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="planning"><a class="header" href="#planning">Planning</a></h1>
<p>We have already alluded to the idea that an OKR can be viewed as promise made at
the end of the Negotiation phase (Q2) of the Workflow: the Customer holds the objective, and the
Performer promises to deliver on some results. This can be operationalized into
planning for the whole company.</p>
<p>A company consists of many Workflows at a time. These Workflows themselves can
correspond to different time horizons. For instance, in a small company, the CEO may be on a 3-yr
Workflow with the board (ie. making a 3-yr promise), while a more junior
employee is only on 3-month Workflows (ie. only making 3-mo promises) with some
project lead. Project leads themselves might be on 1-yr workflows, perhaps
making promises to the CEO, and so on.</p>
<p>This cascading time structure can be used to organize and plan OKRs for the
whole company by articulating objectives at different time horizons and
conceptualizing each one as a workflow, with a dedicated Customer and Performer.
For instance, there may be a single 3-yr Workflow where the CEO is the Performer
and the board is the Customer. Perhaps the CEO is the only person in the company
willing to make a 3-yr promise. Then others, say the CTO, may be the Performer
on a 1-year Workflow with the CEO as Customer. The CTO can see the CEO’s 3-yr
Workflow, and knows about the promises the CEO has made to the board about
results to be delivered over 3 years, but the CTO is maybe only ready to make a
1-yr promise to the CEO to help deliver those results. The CEO makes a 3-yr
promise to the board, and tries to get the CTO to make a series of 1-yr promises
to the CEO to help deliver on the 3-yr promise. In turn the CTO may be a
Customer on other Workflows with other members of the team, say on 1-yr and/or
3-month time horizons, and so on.</p>
<p>In this way, the Performer in a Workflow at one time horizon is often the
Customer for a Workflow on a smaller time horizon. For instance, the CEO makes
3-yr promises to the board, the CTO makes 1-yr promises to the CEO, and an
engineer makes 3-mo promises to the CTO. By mapping out the set of Workflows for
the company’s core objectives and projects, we can get clarity over the
accountability structure without needing to invoke “reporting lines” and
“management”. Instead, we get an effectively equivalent but more explicit model
of how the company is organized based on the kinds of promises people make, to
who, and over what time horizon. This then directly illuminates a trajectory to
scaling the organizational design, by empowering more people to make longer-term
promises. “Hierarchy” emerges here from the explicit responsibilities people are
willing to take in terms of the time-horizon of promises they are willing to
make.</p>
<p>In the end, the goal is for every employee to be asking themselves: “what
promises do I want to make, to whom, and on what time horizon? And what promises
do I want made to me, by whom, and on what time frame?”</p>
<p>For any given time horizon, say 3-months, there may be multiple interlocking
Workflows. For instance, a Product Owner may make 3-mo promises to the CEO,
while simultaneously engineers are making 3-mo promises to the Product Owner.
These promises are clearly dependent on each other, and thus their Workflow
negotiations are “interlocking”. We can refer to this as  “interlocking
Q2s”. I may be negotiating in Q2 with you, but for you to really make a
promise to me as a performer, you may also need to negotiate with your team
members. So there are feedback loops where a bunch of Q2s are being
negotiated at the same time and inter-depend on each other. The planning
process for the company thus consists of effectively propagating the right
information through these negotiations and “settling” these interlocking
Workflow Q2s so that everyone in the company can make a set of
aligned-promises for the next 3-months.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="results"><a class="header" href="#results">Results</a></h1>
<p>Defining good results is hard work. But every Workflow negotiation should end
in a promise to deliver some well defined results. Results should describe the
actual outcome or value you want to create in the world. Often people put down
outputs or activities, not outcomes. “Publish 5 papers” is an output, not an
outcome. Why do you want to publish those posts? For what purpose? What outcome
are you really looking for? What value do you want to create in the world?</p>
<p>Activities are things we do. Outputs are things we produce from our activities.
Outcomes are the value we create by our activities and outputs. Good results
are outcomes. When defining OKRs, we want to focus on defining the real
outcomes we want. This is often tricky and feels a bit contrived. It’s obvious
why we want to publish 5 papers. Or is it?</p>
<p>Often it’s recommended to pursue SMART results: Specific, Measurable,
Attainable, Relevant, Time Bound. This can be helpful. Our results are by
default time bound because they are part of time bound Workflows. And we can
make them measurable by finding some quantitative measure, like publishing 5
papers. But we can make the result more specific and relevant by specifying:
publish 5 papers in top distributed systems journals on applying verification
techniques to real world distributed systems.</p>
<p>Ok, this is more specific and relevant and everything. But really, still, why
do we want to do that? It’s still framed as a kind of output, not an outcome.
An outcome tends to be something you have less control over - it’s the actual
outcome you want to procure in the world. Sure, there’s peer review, so you
can’t guarantee the paper will be published. But maybe a better result is “Have
2 different members of the team get invited to speak at a top conference on
formal verification in blockchain” - this doesn’t even say anything about how
many papers to publish, but it gets at the heart of what we might actually want
out of publishing some papers.</p>
<p>One helpful way to think about defining results is by types of results. We
identify four major categories of results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer Value (CV)</li>
<li>Adoption (A)</li>
<li>Reputational (R)</li>
<li>Sustainability (S).</li>
</ul>
<p>It helps to try and roughly balance the results for an objective across these
categories. Customer Value refers to the value we create for users. Adoption is
about getting more people using our stuff. Reputational results increase our
reputation in the world. Sustainability results show greater revenue or
capacity within the team.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to write good results, write the activities you think you
should perform and the outputs you think you should produce. Then ask, why do I
want to do these things? What outcome do I really want ? What value do I want
to create in the world? Often it’s just a small change in phrasing that’s
required. For instance, instead of “Promote cephalopod as a leading validator”,
which is clearly an activity, a better result would be “Two independent news
articles mention Cephalopod as a leading validator” or “a thousand people
understand that Cephalopod is a leading validator”.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s less important what specific text you write for a
result. The more important thing is the conversation you have with your team
around the result and the shared understanding you build around what you’re
doing and why and what you plan to achieve in the next time horizon. OKRs are a
tool for building shared understanding in the teams and across the company
about what we’re doing and why, for the purpose of increasing autonomy and
improving coordination, getting us all resonating and rowing in the same
directions.</p>
<p>For some good resources on OKRs, see

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="kpis"><a class="header" href="#kpis">KPIs</a></h1>
<p>Key Performance Indicators seem like some kind of alternative to OKRs. But
they’re not. They’re complementary. KPIs are the day-to-day health checks and
performance metrics. OKRs are what we use to improve our KPIs.</p>
<p>The company is an organism. It does business day-to-day. We can monitor its
health by tracking some set of standard metrics - our KPIs. These tell us how
we’re doing day-to-day. Using the KPIs, we can figure out what we need to
improve in the company. Someone in the company will hold the concern for making
that improvement, and will engage a Workflow to realize it. That Workflow,
through its Q2 promise, includes an OKR focused on achieving those improvements.
Once an OKR is achieved, it “precipitates” into the KPIs. For instance, we may
monitor the kinds of audit requests we’re getting, maybe they’re all small
audits of $20k. We might decide we want to improve that, so we set some OKRs to
increase the average size of audits (which may involve all kinds of objectives
and results, including more powerful verification tools or something). Once we
meet the OKRs, they should translate into our KPIs - now our average audit size
should be higher, and that’s become our new day-to-day KPI target.</p>
<p>Thus the KPIs become a kind of health check of the company that we can use to
determine what OKRs we need to set in the next quarter (or year, etc.) to
improve. Over time, many common OKRs will just mature into KPI targets and will
become business as usual. This allows our OKR framework to really focus on what
we need to do to improve, and take the company to the next level.</p>
<p>Since we’re just getting started, many things which should probably just be KPI
targets are listed now as OKRs. Over the coming months, we’ll work on a KPI
dashboard, and we’ll use that to then figure out what OKRs we’ll need (ie. what
kind of improvements we want to see in the KPIs). There’s a KPI sheet with some
initial ideas of things to track.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="roles"><a class="header" href="#roles">Roles</a></h1>
<p>Workflow provides a way to construct roles from the bottom-up by understanding
a role as an abstraction over repeated workflows. Any role can be defined by
the kinds of Workflows it is engaged in.</p>
<p>We prefer not to use the term “manager” as it is overloaded and comes with many
connotations. Management is effectively a collection of a number of distinct
concerns which may be better understood as distinct roles. Management on a
project can usually be decomposed into three distinct functions: Product,
Project, and People. Product Management takes care of what to build, Project
Management takes care of building it on time, and People Management takes care
of the people. All three functionalities are critical, but it is extremely rare
for a single individual to have the time, let alone the skills, to provide all
of them. Thus, it is recommended that they be understood as three distinct roles
and that any individual be responsible for at most two. In addition to these
three functions of management, there is also the function of technical
leadership.</p>
<p>Thus, in line with this understanding and with common experience, we recognize
three key leadership roles for each project, which in a mature project are
expected to be full-time roles played by distinct individuals.</p>
<h3 id="list-of-roles"><a class="header" href="#list-of-roles">List of Roles</a></h3>
<p>Product Owner - Determine the right thing to build. Focus on the Users</p>
<p>Concern:  Building products that are used by customers, understanding what is
important to users/customers + relevant to the market.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="stewardship"><a class="header" href="#stewardship">Stewardship</a></h1>
<p>Stewardship is a key function that is often lumped in with project-specific
management, but which really need not, or even should not, be. It may be
extremely beneficial to disentangle an individual's project-specific concerns
from the concerns for that individual’s well-being. Since Stewardship is not
project-specific, it need not be provided by someone on the same team, or even
by someone with any kind of “management” designation. For instance, some
engineer may not want formal “management” responsibilities for a project but may
have very strong emotional intelligence and be willing to, with say 20% of their
time, play the Steward role for a small handful of other employees.</p>
<p>In this way, Stewardship can be distributed throughout the organization so it
can be played by the people most suited to it, without confounding it with
project-specific management functions. Some fraction of the company, say 20%,
who are most suited for the role, should be explicitly and continuously trained
in Stewardship and provide, say, 20% of their time as Stewards for other
employees.</p>
<p>At Informal, currently, Melissa and Laura are playing the Stewardship role for
the entire company. Though they are now beginning to train up a select few
employees to take on Stewardship roles with some small proportion of their time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functional-teams"><a class="header" href="#functional-teams">Functional Teams</a></h1>
<p>Some teams might be thought of as “horizontal” or “functional”, rather than
project-based. Things like ops/finance, marketing/design, and developer
relations. In certain cases it may make sense for a project team to have its own
dedicated personnel in these functions on the teams, but often these functions
will be provided generally/horizontally across the company.</p>
<p>We can consider each of these functions as a project in itself. It doesn’t quite
have the same structure as other projects though, since they work horizontally
across all other projects. All projects will need some ops/finance,
marketing/design, and devrels resources. Thus we have slightly more complicated
Workflows here.</p>
<p>One model for understanding these “horizontals” is through a set of 4 kinds of
Workflows. For instance:</p>
<p>First, the CEO has a 1 year Workflow as Customer with the COO as Performer to
create a robust pool of “horizontal” resources to support all teams in the
company (please excuse the “resources” terminology). This Workflow is concerned
with the general availability of horizontal resources in the company. The main
result of this Workflow is that when product owners are asked if they feel well
supported by and get what they need from say marketing and design, they nod
excitedly.</p>
<p>Second, each product owner has say a 1 year Workflow as Customer with the COO as
Performer to ensure the “horizontal” teams have the specific capabilities and
capacities those products need. Each product will have distinct needs, and it’s
the COO’s responsibility, through her Workflow with each product owner, to
ensure the company has a pool of “horizontal resources” to meet those specific
needs.</p>
<p>Third, the COO has a 3 month Workflow with each individual “horizontal” employee,
say, individual finance, marketing or developer relations people, where the COO
sets the general expectations of how they should interact with the rest of the
company. The COO holds the same concern as the CEO, but holds it on the shorter
time horizon with the individual horizontal team members, while the CEO holds it
on the 1 year time horizon just with the COO.</p>
<p>Finally, each product owner has a 3 month Workflow with the specific members of the
horizontal teams for their specific needs. For instance, the PO of Tendermint
will have a 3 month Workflow with some individual marketing person for the marketing
results needed for Tendermint that quarter.</p>
<p>We could summarize this in the following table:</p>
<pre><code>TODO
</code></pre>
<p>This is at least a rough idea of the model. Of course it will be difficult to capture all these Workflows directly, but we should be aware they exist. To the extent, for instance, that someone is doing any marketing work for any product, there is an implicit Workflow there, where they are pursuing some results for the product’s owner. We can be more explicit about these Workflows and have more Q2 negotiations :)</p>
<p>Notice how the Workflow language helps decompose the role of the COO in this instance. She is Customer for some, Performer for others. Workflow helps us be crystal clear about what different people are responsible for and to whom, and how to determine if they’re doing a good job.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d note that at Galois, the idea is that the entire company is the horizontal pool. Every so often they hold a marketplace-like event where Customers and Performers shop around for work within the company. This is a bit mind blowing, but it does make sense. Perhaps this is something to work towards, though it may be more challenging with the large software projects.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="decision-authorities"><a class="header" href="#decision-authorities">Decision Authorities</a></h1>
<p>A short note on decision authorities. Rather than naively associate decision
authorities with “management” roles, they can be more intelligently and
deliberately distributed throughout the company.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of decision authorities. We use the RAID model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommend (R) - authority to recommend/propose a particular decision</li>
<li>Align / Approve (A) - authority to effectively veto a decision</li>
<li>Input (I) - authority to provide input on a decision</li>
<li>Decide (D) - authority to authorize the decision</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the power resides in the R, since this is where proposals come from.
Those with “A” are required to be aligned with the R, while input is sought from
those with “I”. The “D” authority is responsible for ensuring all other
authorities were correctly followed, and for ultimately authorizing the
decision. RAID is a common decision model you can read more about elsewhere.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to think that a RAID applies to the OKRs - that there is a
RAID on the Q2 of Workflow, so maybe the Performer is the R and the team members
are the A and the Customer is the D. That’s wrong. That’s what I thought
originally too but it’s wrong.</p>
<p>There is no RAID on the OKRs. The OKRs follow from the negotiations between
Customer and Performer. There are interlocking Q2s which ensure that all the
Workflows in the company align correctly. But at the end of the day the Q2
promise is the negotiation between Customer and Performer, it’s not a “decision”
determined through RAID.</p>
<p>However, in the day-to-day of executing a Workflow (ie. in Q3), certain
decisions will need to be made: hiring a new team member, sponsoring a
conference, deciding a new technology to adopt, etc. These are where the RAIDs
kick in. Generally speaking, we will have clear roles (there’s many more roles
than just the 3 roles we discussed), which will come with decision authorities
that are expected to be utilized effectively in executing whatever Workflows are
part of that role. For instance, a product owner is typically the hiring manager
for their team, and will thus have R for hiring. Other team members will have A
for hiring. Interviewers have I. The COO will have D. Hiring managers should be
thought of as executing 3 month or 1 year Workflows with the COO to grow their
teams, with general results of the rules they need to follow for hiring.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="meetings"><a class="header" href="#meetings">Meetings</a></h1>
<p>Every meeting can be understood as a Workflow.</p>
<p>In Q1, the meeting is scheduled and the necessary participants are invited.</p>
<p>Every meeting should begin with a Q2 where results for the meeting are
negotiated. Most good meetings already contain some form of agenda, but it helps
to be explicit that a good agenda is really a negotiated set of results for the
meeting. Often an agenda is just a list of items to discuss, but it helps to
articulate what outcomes you really want out of the meeting - what are the
results? What value are we trying to create out of this meeting? What do we want
to be able to do when the meeting is over that we couldn’t do before? The notes
on good results from above are helpful here.</p>
<p>Note that in a meeting, every participant is both a Customer and Performer for
those results.</p>
<p>Q3 is the meeting execution, where meeting participants seek to deliver the
results they negotiated in the agenda during Q2. It’s important to pay attention
to time, refocus on the outcomes you’re seeking as necessary, and set action
items to be reviewed in the next meeting. If necessary, renegotiate the results
as you go, if you discover that you won’t have enough time for everything or you
have some leftover time, as the case may be.</p>
<p>Finally, each meeting should include a short Q4 at the end, where participants
can review the value they got out of the meeting. Did they meet the results? Did
they cover topics on top? Did things happen that could have been better handled?
What value was produced? What can they do now that they couldn’t do before?</p>
<p>If you start doing a Q4 at the end of each meeting, you can be more honest and
explicit about the quality of your meetings. Maybe you’ll find that they’re not
delivering much value. Once you do it a few times, you’ll either decide to stop
having the meeting, or figure out how to improve them by negotiating better
results!</p>

<p>Glossary of Workflow terms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workflow</strong> - language for describing, diagnosing, and constructing accountability relationships</li>
<li><strong>Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4</strong> - the four stages of a Workflow (Listen, Negotiate, Execute, Assess)</li>
<li><strong>Customer</strong> - Holds the concern in a Workflow. Responsible for the Performer’s success!</li>
<li><strong>Performer</strong> - Makes a promise to a Customer within a Workflow. Responsible for delivering some results</li>
<li><strong>Concern</strong> - The objective held by the Customer. The thing they are trying to take care of</li>
<li><strong>Results</strong> - The outcome the Performer promises to deliver to address the Customer’s concern. Results are about the value you are creating in the world. Also known as Outcome or Conditions of Satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>Outputs and Activities</strong> - these are not results. These are things a Performer will produce or do to achieve their desired outcome/results. It’s important to negotiate on Results, and leave Outputs and Activities up to the Performer, otherwise you end up micro-managing.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiation</strong> - this is the Q2 stage in the Workflow where Customer and Performer negotiate results</li>
<li><strong>Promise</strong> - at the end of a Q2 negotiation, the Performer makes a Promise to deliver certain results.</li>
<li><strong>Renegotiation</strong> - sometimes during Execution (Q3) a promise needs to be renegotiated, ie. the Workflow needs to return to Q2</li>
<li><strong>Assessment</strong> - this is the Q4 stage in the Workflow where Customer and Performer assess the outcome</li>
<li><strong>RAID</strong> - a decision making model with 4 authorities: Recommend, Align, Input, Decide. To be used generally during Q3 (Execution) of a Workflow, when decisions need to be made.</li>
