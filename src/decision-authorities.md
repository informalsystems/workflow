# Decision Authorities

A short note on decision authorities. Rather than naively associate decision
authorities with “management” roles, they can be more intelligently and
deliberately distributed throughout the company.

There are different kinds of decision authorities. We use the RAID model:

- Recommend (R) - authority to recommend/propose a particular decision
- Align / Approve (A) - authority to effectively veto a decision
- Input (I) - authority to provide input on a decision
- Decide (D) - authority to authorize the decision

Most of the power resides in the R, since this is where proposals come from.
Those with “A” are required to be aligned with the R, while input is sought from
those with “I”. The “D” authority is responsible for ensuring all other
authorities were correctly followed, and for ultimately authorizing the
decision. RAID is a common decision model you can read more about elsewhere.

You may be tempted to think that a RAID applies to the OKRs - that there is a
RAID on the Q2 of Workflow, so maybe the Performer is the R and the team members
are the A and the Customer is the D. That’s wrong. That’s what I thought
originally too but it’s wrong.

There is no RAID on the OKRs. The OKRs follow from the negotiations between
Customer and Performer. There are interlocking Q2s which ensure that all the
Workflows in the company align correctly. But at the end of the day the Q2
promise is the negotiation between Customer and Performer, it’s not a “decision”
determined through RAID.

However, in the day-to-day of executing a Workflow (ie. in Q3), certain
decisions will need to be made: hiring a new team member, sponsoring a
conference, deciding a new technology to adopt, etc. These are where the RAIDs
kick in. Generally speaking, we will have clear roles (there’s many more roles
than just the 3 roles we discussed), which will come with decision authorities
that are expected to be utilized effectively in executing whatever Workflows are
part of that role. For instance, a product owner is typically the hiring manager
for their team, and will thus have R for hiring. Other team members will have A
for hiring. Interviewers have I. The COO will have D. Hiring managers should be
thought of as executing 3 month or 1 year Workflows with the COO to grow their
teams, with general results of the rules they need to follow for hiring.
