# Stewardship

Stewardship is a key function that is often lumped in with project-specific
management, but which really need not, or even should not, be. It may be
extremely beneficial to disentangle an individual's project-specific concerns
from the concerns for that individual’s well-being. Since Stewardship is not
project-specific, it need not be provided by someone on the same team, or even
by someone with any kind of “management” designation. For instance, some
engineer may not want formal “management” responsibilities for a project but may
have very strong emotional intelligence and be willing to, with say 20% of their
time, play the Steward role for a small handful of other employees, regardless
of what they work on in the company.

In this way, Stewardship can be distributed throughout the organization so the
role can be played by the people most suited to it, without confounding it with
project-specific management functions. Some fraction of the company, say 20%,
who are most suited for the role, should be explicitly and continuously trained
in Stewardship and provide, say, 20% of their time as Stewards for other
employees. One of Informal's engineers reflected on their experience with the
stewards program in their [blog post][adi post].

In our experience, it was helpful to bootstrap the Stewards program by engaging
experienced coaches to serve as initial Stewards for everyone and to help
train people internally to take over stewardship roles.
