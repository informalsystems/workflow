# Functional Teams

Some teams might be thought of as “horizontal” or “functional”, rather than
project-based. Things like ops/finance, marketing/design, and developer
relations. In certain cases it may make sense for a project team to have its own
dedicated personnel in these functions on the teams, but often these functions
will be provided generally/horizontally across the company.

We can consider each of these functions as a project in itself. It doesn’t quite
have the same structure as other projects though, since they work horizontally
across all other projects. All projects will need some ops/finance,
marketing/design, and devrels support. Thus we have slightly more complicated
Workflows here.

One model for understanding these “horizontals” is through a set of 4 kinds of
Workflows. For instance:

| Time Horizon | Customer | Performer | Objective |
|----|----|----|---| 
| 1 year  |   CEO | COO | General availability of marketing for company|
| 1 year  | Product Owner | COO | Specific availability of marketing for product | 
| 3 month | COO | Marketer | General marketing needs for company |
| 3 month | Product Owner | Marketer | Specific marketing needs for product |


First, the CEO has a 1 year Workflow as Customer with the COO as Performer to
create a marketing function to support all teams in the
company. This Workflow is concerned
with the general availability of marketing in the company. The main
result of this Workflow is that when product owners are asked if they feel well
supported by and get what they need from marketing, they say yes.

Second, each product owner has say a 1 year Workflow as Customer with the COO as
Performer to ensure the marketing function has the specific capabilities and
capacities each product needs. Each product will have distinct needs, and it’s
the COO’s responsibility, through her Workflow with each product owner, to
ensure the company has a pool of marketing resources to meet those specific
needs.

Third, the COO has a 3 month Workflow with each individual marketing employee,
where the COO sets the general expectations of how they should interact with the rest of the
company. The COO holds the same concern as the CEO, but holds it on the shorter
time horizon with the individual members of the marketing team, while the CEO holds it
on the 1 year time horizon just with the COO (and for more functions than
marketing).

Finally, each product owner has a 3 month Workflow with the specific members of the
marketing team for their specific needs. For instance, the Product Owner of Tendermint
will have a 3 month Workflow with some individual marketing person for the marketing
results needed for Tendermint that quarter.

Notice how the Workflow language helps decompose the role of the COO here. She is Customer for some, 
Performer for others. Workflow helps us be crystal clear about what different people are responsible for and to whom, and how to determine if they’re doing a good job.

Finally, while we've called out specific functional teams such as devrel,
marketing, design, finance and operations, the [Collaborative Web paper]
considers extending this to all functions in the company, enabling Customers and Performers from across
the company to discover new ways to work together.
