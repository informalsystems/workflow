# Functional Teams

Some teams might be thought of as “horizontal” or “functional”, rather than
project-based. Things like ops/finance, marketing/design, and developer
relations. In certain cases it may make sense for a project team to have its own
dedicated personnel in these functions on the teams, but often these functions
will be provided generally/horizontally across the company.

We can consider each of these functions as a project in itself. It doesn’t quite
have the same structure as other projects though, since they work horizontally
across all other projects. All projects will need some ops/finance,
marketing/design, and devrels resources. Thus we have slightly more complicated
Workflows here.

One model for understanding these “horizontals” is through a set of 4 kinds of
Workflows. For instance:

First, the CEO has a 1 year Workflow as Customer with the COO as Performer to
create a robust pool of “horizontal” resources to support all teams in the
company (please excuse the “resources” terminology). This Workflow is concerned
with the general availability of horizontal resources in the company. The main
result of this Workflow is that when product owners are asked if they feel well
supported by and get what they need from say marketing and design, they nod
excitedly.

Second, each product owner has say a 1 year Workflow as Customer with the COO as
Performer to ensure the “horizontal” teams have the specific capabilities and
capacities those products need. Each product will have distinct needs, and it’s
the COO’s responsibility, through her Workflow with each product owner, to
ensure the company has a pool of “horizontal resources” to meet those specific
needs.

Third, the COO has a 3 month Workflow with each individual “horizontal” employee,
say, individual finance, marketing or developer relations people, where the COO
sets the general expectations of how they should interact with the rest of the
company. The COO holds the same concern as the CEO, but holds it on the shorter
time horizon with the individual horizontal team members, while the CEO holds it
on the 1 year time horizon just with the COO.

Finally, each product owner has a 3 month Workflow with the specific members of the
horizontal teams for their specific needs. For instance, the PO of Tendermint
will have a 3 month Workflow with some individual marketing person for the marketing
results needed for Tendermint that quarter.

We could summarize this in the following table:

```
TODO
```

This is at least a rough idea of the model. Of course it will be difficult to capture all these Workflows directly, but we should be aware they exist. To the extent, for instance, that someone is doing any marketing work for any product, there is an implicit Workflow there, where they are pursuing some results for the product’s owner. We can be more explicit about these Workflows and have more Q2 negotiations :)

Notice how the Workflow language helps decompose the role of the COO in this instance. She is Customer for some, Performer for others. Workflow helps us be crystal clear about what different people are responsible for and to whom, and how to determine if they’re doing a good job.

Finally, I’d note that at Galois, the idea is that the entire company is the horizontal pool. Every so often they hold a marketplace-like event where Customers and Performers shop around for work within the company. This is a bit mind blowing, but it does make sense. Perhaps this is something to work towards, though it may be more challenging with the large software projects.
