# What is Workflow?

Workflow is a language for describing, diagnosing, and constructing
accountability relationships within an organization. It is effectively a model
for making and managing promises. It was taught to Informal over the last year
or so by Melissa Angeli and Laura McKinney of Jaquarden Consulting, with
powerful results.  Laura and Melissa were previously the CEO and Head of HR for
Galois, a successful R&D company in the US with an acclaimed organizational
design, known as the collaborative web. Their paper on the subject describes
common dysfunctions in management and leadership and how the collaborative web
structure resolves them. It is well worth reading.

At Informal we feel that workflow is a model for how to organize and scale
organizations and we believe it can provide tremendous value to companies
looking to scale in a sustainable way. 

We can describe Workflow as: A model for how we navigate promises. The model can be used to: 
- Diagnose issues interfering with our work together
- Provide structure for new work
- Build empathy and relationship by seeing promise making and keeping as a skill to be developed
- Enhance communication by tools that allow people to focus on the barriers and issues directly. 

The model is useful for small tasks through complex partnerships. In the end, it
facilitates trust. The model is straightforward to learn and can be put into
practice immediately. The value of the model is only experienced over time, as
it is used consistently and becomes part of the Culture.

By providing a language for talking about promises - about the stages of promise
making and redemption - Workflow helps eliminate a lot of the ambiguity and
awkwardness that can come from dealing with accountability. In doing so, it
illuminates opportunities for improved organizational practices and designs.

In the rest of this guide, we describe the model and some of the many aspects of an organization it
sheds light on: planning and OKRs, project roles, effective meetings, functional
teams, decision authorities, employee stewardship, KPIs, etc.
