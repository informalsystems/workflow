# Planning

We have already alluded to the idea that an OKR can be viewed as promise made at
the end of the Negotiation phase (Q2) of the workflow: the customer holds the objective, and the
performer promises to deliver on some results. This can be operationalized into
planning for the whole company.

A company consists of many workflows at a time. These workflows themselves can
correspond to different time horizons. For instance, in a small company, the CEO may be on a 3-yr
workflow with the board (ie. making a 3-yr promise), while a more junior
employee is only on 3-month workflows (ie. only making 3-mo promises) with some
project lead. Project leads themselves might be on 1-yr workflows, perhaps
making promises to the CEO. And so on.

This cascading time structure can be used to organize and plan OKRs for the
whole company by articulating objectives at different time horizons and
conceptualizing each one as a workflow, with a dedicated customer and performer.
For instance, there may be a single 3-yr workflow where the CEO is the performer
and the board is the customer. Perhaps the CEO is the only person in the company
willing to make a 3-yr promise. Then others, say the CTO, may be the performer
on a 1-year workflow with the CEO as customer. The CTO can see the CEO’s 3-yr
workflow, and knows about the promises the CEO has made to the board about
results to be delivered over 3 years, but the CTO is maybe only ready to make a
1-yr promise to the CEO to help deliver those results. The CEO makes a 3-yr
promise to the board, and tries to get the CTO to make a series of 1-yr promises
to the CEO to help deliver on the 3-yr promise. In turn the CTO may be a
customer on other workflows with other members of the team, say on 1-yr and/or
3-month time horizons. And so on. 

In this way, the performer in a workflow at one time horizon is often the
customer for a workflow on a smaller time horizon. For instance, the CEO makes
3-yr promises to the board, the CTO makes 1-yr promises to the CEO, and an
engineer makes 3-mo promises to the CTO. By mapping out the set of workflows for
the company’s core objectives and projects, we can get clarity over the
accountability structure without needing to invoke “reporting lines” and
“management”. Instead, we get an effectively equivalent but more explicit model
of how the company is organized based on the kinds of promises people make, to
who, and over what time horizon. This then directly illuminates a trajectory to
scaling the organizational design, by empowering more people to make longer-term
promises. “Hierarchy” emerges here from the explicit responsibilities people are
willing to take in terms of the time-horizon of promises they are willing to
make.

In the end, the goal is for every employee to be asking themselves: “what
promises do I want to make, to whom, and on what time horizon? And what promises
do I want made to me, by whom, and on what time frame?” 

For any given time horizon, say 3-months, there may be multiple interlocking
workflows. For instance, a Product Owner may make 3-mo promises to the CEO,
while simultaneously engineers are making 3-mo promises to the Product Owner.
These promises are clearly dependent on each other, and thus their workflow
negotiations are “interlocking”. We can refer to this as  “interlocking
Q2s”. I may be negotiating in Q2 with you, but for you to really make a
promise to me as a performer, you may also need to negotiate with your team
members. So there are feedback loops where a bunch of Q2s are being
negotiated at the same time and inter-depend on each other. The planning
process for the company thus consists of effectively propagating the right
information through these negotiations and “settling” these interlocking
workflow Q2s so that everyone in the company can make a set of
aligned-promises for the next 3-months.
