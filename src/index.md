# Workflow (v0.1.0)

Workflow is a language for describing, diagnosing, and constructing
accountability relationships within an organization. It is effectively a
language for making and managing promises. 
It was taught to us, Informal Systems, by Melissa Angeli and Laura McKinney of Jaquarden Consulting, with
[powerful results][blog post]. Laura and Melissa were previously the CEO and Head of HR, respectively, for
Galois, a successful R&D company in the US with an acclaimed organizational
design, known as the [collaborative web][The Collaborative Web paper]. Their paper on the subject describes
common dysfunctions in management and leadership and how the collaborative web
structure resolves them. It is well worth reading.

At Informal we feel that workflow is a language for organizing and scaling
organizations and we believe it can provide tremendous value to companies
looking to scale in a sustainable way.

We can describe Workflow as a language for navigating promises. The language can be used to:
- Diagnose issues interfering with our work together
- Provide structure for new work
- Build empathy and relationship by seeing promise making and keeping as a skill to be developed
- Enhance communication by tools that allow people to focus on the barriers and issues directly.

The language is useful for small tasks through complex partnerships. In the end, it
facilitates trust. The language is straightforward to learn and can be put into
practice immediately. The value of the language is only experienced over time, as
it is used consistently and becomes interwoven with the organization's culture.

By providing a language for talking about promises - about the stages of promise making and redemption -
Workflow helps eliminate a lot of the ambiguity and
awkwardness that can come from dealing with accountability. In doing so, it
illuminates opportunities for improved organizational practices and designs.

In the rest of this guide, we describe the Workflow language and the elements of an organization it
sheds light on: planning and OKRs, project roles, effective meetings, functional
teams, decision authorities, employee stewardship, KPIs, etc. This guide is a
work in progress, and will be updated to reflect our evolving understanding.
See our [blog post][blog post] for more information on why we
decided to adopt the Workflow language into our organizational design. And if you're interested in joining us, [we're hiring].
