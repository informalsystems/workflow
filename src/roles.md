# Roles


Workflow provides a way to construct roles from the bottom-up by understanding
a role as an abstraction over repeated workflows. Any role can be defined by
the kinds of workflows it is engaged in. 

We prefer not to use the term “manager” as it is overloaded and comes with many
connotations. Management is effectively a collection of a number of distinct
concerns which may be better understood as distinct roles. Management on a
project can usually be decomposed into three distinct functions: Product,
Project, and People. Product Management takes care of what to build, Project
Management takes care of building it on time, and People Management takes care
of the people. All three functionalities are critical, but it is extremely rare
for a single individual to have the time, let alone the skills, to provide all
of them. Thus it is recommended that they be understood as three distinct roles
and that any individual be responsible for at most two. In addition to these
three functions of management, there is also the function of technical
leadership.

Thus, in line with this understanding and with common experience, we recognize
three key leadership roles for each Project, which in a mature project are
expected to be full-time roles played by distinct individuals.
